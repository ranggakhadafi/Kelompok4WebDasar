                <h3>Hot Rolled Coil/Plate</h3>
                <p>Hot-rolled steel in the form of coils and plates is a type of steel product produced through</p>
                <p>the hot rolling process. Manufacturers and users of this steel type commonly refer to this</p>
                <p>product as 'black steel,' distinguishing it from cold-rolled steel sheets, also known as 'white </p>
                <p>steel.</p>

                <h3>Cold Rolled Coil/Sheet</h3>
                <p>Cold-rolled steel, commonly known as 'white steel,' is a type of steel product produced</p>
                <p>through the cold rolling process. This 'white steel' possesses distinct properties significantly</p>
                <p>different from 'black steel' or hot-rolled steel sheets. Cold-rolled steel exhibits superior</p>
                <p>surface quality, thinner gauges, precise dimensions, excellent mechanical properties, and</p>
                <p>exceptional formability. Steel in this category is widely utilized in forming processes due to</p>
                <p>its superior formability, weldability, and surface roughness quality.</p>

                <h3>Wire Rod</h3>
                <p>Wire rods are manufactured from steel billets, which categorizes them as long products,</p>
                <p>distinguishing them from hot-rolled steel sheets and cold-rolled steel sheets made from</p>
                <p>steel slabs. Wire rods are typically classified based on their carbon content: low, medium, or</p>
                <p>high-carbon wire rods. Additionally, wire rods are categorized based on their specific</p>
                <p>applications.</p>
